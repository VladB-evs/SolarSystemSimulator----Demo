## Image Guidelines

This directory contains images of planets and celestial bodies used throughout the website. To maintain consistent quality:

- Images should be optimized for web use
- Maintain consistent dimensions for proper display in planet cards
- Use high-quality, scientifically accurate representations
- Include appropriate alt text for accessibility

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript for interactive features
- Modern web fonts for typography
- Responsive design principles

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. No build process required - it's a static website
3. Open index.html in a modern web browser
4. For best experience, use a browser with WebGL support
