            <h2>About Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Known as the Red Planet due to the iron oxide prevalent on its surface, Mars has a thin atmosphere and features that resemble both the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
            
            <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (95%), nitrogen (2.8%), and argon (2%). The atmospheric pressure on the Martian surface is only about 0.6% of Earth's mean sea level pressure. This thin atmosphere provides little protection from solar radiation and cannot sustain liquid water on the surface for extended periods.</p>
            
            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Both are irregularly shaped and orbit close to the planet.</p>
            
            <h3>Mars's Structure</h3>
            <p>Mars's internal structure consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A metallic core made primarily of iron and nickel with about 16-17% sulfur</li>
                <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> A silicate mantle that is less dense and more iron-rich than Earth's</li>
                <li><strong>Crust:</strong> A thin crust averaging 50 km in thickness</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mars's Surface</h3>
            <p>The surface of Mars is marked by several notable features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Olympus Mons:</strong> The largest volcano in the Solar System, standing 22 km high and spanning 600 km in diameter</li>
                <li><strong>Valles Marineris:</strong> A system of canyons that runs along the Martian equator, stretching for nearly 4,000 km</li>
                <li><strong>Polar Ice Caps:</strong> Composed of water ice and carbon dioxide ice that expand and contract with the Martian seasons</li>
                <li><strong>Impact Craters:</strong> Numerous craters dot the surface, including the massive Hellas Planitia, an impact basin 2,300 km in diameter</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mars's Orbit and Rotation</h3>
            <p>Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of 227.9 million km, completing one orbit every 687 Earth days. Its orbit is more eccentric than Earth's, which contributes to its more extreme seasonal variations. Mars rotates on its axis once every 24.6 hours, creating a day-night cycle similar to Earth's.</p>
            
            <p>Mars's axis is tilted at about 25.2 degrees, similar to Earth's 23.5-degree tilt. This tilt causes Mars to experience seasons like Earth, though they last nearly twice as long due to Mars's longer year.</p>

            <h3>Mars's Moons</h3>
            <div class="moons-grid">
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Phobos</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 22.2 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Mars: 9,377 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 7.7 hours</p>
                    <p>Phobos is the larger and closer of Mars's two moons. It orbits so close to Mars that it completes an orbit in less than a Martian day, rising in the west and setting in the east. Phobos is gradually spiraling inward and will either crash into Mars or break up to form a ring in about 50 million years.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Deimos</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 12.6 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Mars: 23,460 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 30.3 hours</p>
                    <p>Deimos is the smaller and more distant of Mars's two moons. It appears star-like from the surface of Mars due to its small size and distance. Like Phobos, Deimos is believed to be a captured asteroid.</p>
