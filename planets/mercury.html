            <h2>About Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its proximity to the Sun makes it difficult to observe from Earth, as it's only visible during twilight. Despite its small size, Mercury is very dense, composed mainly of heavy metals and rock.</p>
            
            <p>The surface of Mercury resembles that of our Moon, featuring numerous impact craters and smooth plains. It has no atmosphere to speak of, which results in some of the most extreme temperature variations in the Solar System. The side facing the Sun can reach temperatures of up to 430°C (800°F), while the night side can drop to -180°C (-290°F).</p>
            
            <p>Mercury has no moons and no rings. It has a large iron core that generates a magnetic field about 1% as strong as Earth's.</p>
            
            <h3>Mercury's Structure</h3>
            <p>Mercury's internal structure consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A large iron-rich core that takes up about 55% of the planet's volume</li>
                <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> A silicate mantle approximately 500-700 km thick</li>
                <li><strong>Crust:</strong> A thin crust estimated to be about 100-300 km thick</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Mercury's Orbit and Rotation</h3>
            <p>Mercury has a highly eccentric orbit, meaning it's not perfectly circular. Its distance from the Sun ranges from 46 million km at its closest point (perihelion) to 70 million km at its farthest point (aphelion). Mercury completes one orbit around the Sun every 88 Earth days.</p>
            
            <p>Mercury has a unique rotational pattern. It rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two orbits around the Sun. This 3:2 spin-orbit resonance means that a day on Mercury (one complete rotation) lasts about 176 Earth days, while its year is 88 Earth days. As a result, a single day-night cycle on Mercury takes two Mercury years.</p>

        <div class="moons-section">
            <h3>Mercury's Moons</h3>
            <p>Mercury has no moons. Its proximity to the Sun and small size make it difficult for the planet to capture and retain natural satellites.</p>
