            <h2>About The Sun</h2>
            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
            
            <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, while the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.</p>
            
            <p>The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion years and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After this, it will swell to become a red giant, eventually shedding its outer layers and leaving behind a white dwarf.</p>
            
            <h3>The Sun's Structure</h3>
            <p>The Sun's interior consists of several layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> The central region where nuclear fusion produces energy. The temperature is about 15 million °C, and the density is about 150 times that of water.</li>
                <li><strong>Radiative Zone:</strong> The layer where energy is transported by radiation. It extends from the core to about 70% of the way to the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Convective Zone:</strong> The outer layer where energy is transported by convection. Hot plasma rises and cooler plasma sinks, creating convection currents.</li>
                <li><strong>Photosphere:</strong> The visible "surface" of the Sun with a temperature of about 5,500°C.</li>
                <li><strong>Chromosphere:</strong> A thin layer above the photosphere that can be seen during total solar eclipses as a reddish rim.</li>
                <li><strong>Corona:</strong> The outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, which extends millions of kilometers into space and is much hotter than the surface (over 1 million °C).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Solar Activity</h3>
            <p>The Sun is not a static object. It exhibits various forms of activity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sunspots:</strong> Temporary phenomena on the photosphere that appear as dark spots. They are areas of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux.</li>
                <li><strong>Solar Flares:</strong> Sudden flashes of increased brightness on the Sun, usually observed near sunspots. They are caused by the release of magnetic energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs):</strong> Large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the corona. They can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Solar Wind:</strong> A stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun. It creates the heliosphere, a vast bubble in the interstellar medium.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Sun's Energy Production</h3>
            <p>The Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion in its core. In this process, hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. Each second, the Sun converts about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, releasing energy equivalent to the explosion of 91 billion one-megaton nuclear bombs.</p>
            
            <p>This energy radiates outward from the core and takes about 170,000 years to reach the surface. From there, it takes just over 8 minutes for the light to reach Earth.</p>
            
            <h3>The Sun's Influence on the Solar System</h3>
            <p>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System. Its gravitational field keeps the planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other objects in orbit. The Sun's radiation provides almost all the energy for life on Earth and influences the climate and weather patterns of all planets with atmospheres.</p>
