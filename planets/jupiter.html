            <h2>About Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume.</p>
            
            <p>The planet's most famous feature is the Great Red Spot, a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere, producing an anticyclonic storm that is larger than Earth and has been observed since at least 1831. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, and with 79 known moons, it forms a kind of miniature solar system.</p>
            
            <h3>Jupiter's Structure</h3>
            <p>Jupiter does not have a solid surface like terrestrial planets. Instead, it has layers of increasingly denser materials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with cloud layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Hydrogen Layer:</strong> Below the atmosphere, hydrogen is compressed into a liquid state</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Metallic Hydrogen Layer:</strong> Under even greater pressure, hydrogen becomes metallic and conducts electricity</li>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A dense core of rock, metals, and hydrogen compounds, possibly 15-45 times Earth's mass</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Jupiter's Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>Jupiter's atmosphere is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. It contains colorful cloud bands and spots:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud Bands:</strong> The light-colored zones and darker belts that circle the planet are created by strong east-west winds in Jupiter's upper atmosphere</li>
                <li><strong>Great Red Spot:</strong> A giant, persistent storm about 1.3 times the diameter of Earth that has existed for at least 400 years</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Primarily hydrogen (89%) and helium (10%), with small amounts of ammonia, methane, water vapor, and other compounds</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Jupiter's Magnetic Field</h3>
            <p>Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the Solar System, nearly 20,000 times stronger than Earth's. This powerful magnetosphere traps charged particles from the solar wind and from Jupiter's volcanic moon Io, creating intense radiation belts around the planet.</p>
            
            <h3>Jupiter's Ring System</h3>
            <p>Jupiter has a faint ring system composed of dust particles ejected from some of its smaller moons by meteoroid impacts. The ring system has three main components: the halo ring, the main ring, and the gossamer rings.</p>

        <div class="moons-section">
            <h3>Jupiter's Major Moons</h3>
            <p>Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610:</p>
            <div class="moons-grid">
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Io</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 3,643 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Jupiter: 421,700 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 1.77 days</p>
                    <p>Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System, with hundreds of active volcanoes. Its surface is constantly being reshaped by volcanic eruptions of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Europa</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 3,122 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Jupiter: 670,900 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 3.55 days</p>
                    <p>Europa has a smooth, icy surface with few craters. Scientists believe it has a subsurface ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust, making it a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Ganymede</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 5,268 km</p>

                    <p>Orbital Period: 7.15 days</p>
                    <p>Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, even larger than the planet Mercury. It has its own magnetic field and is believed to have a subsurface ocean.</p>

                    <p>Orbital Period: 16.69 days</p>
                    <p>Callisto has the oldest and most heavily cratered surface of the Galilean moons. It may also have a subsurface ocean and is the outermost of the four large moons.</p>
