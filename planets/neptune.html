            <h2>About Neptune</h2>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known planet from the Sun in our Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years.</p>
            
            <p>Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather than through regular observations of the sky. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on September 23, 1846, by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier.</p>
            
            <p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly after the planet's discovery, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.</p>
            
            <h3>Neptune's Structure</h3>
            <p>Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A solid core composed of rock and ice, with a mass about equal to Earth</li>
                <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> A mantle composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> An atmosphere consisting primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Neptune's Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen (80%):</strong> The most abundant element</li>
                <li><strong>Helium (19%):</strong> The second most abundant element</li>
                <li><strong>Methane (1.5%):</strong> Gives Neptune its blue color by absorbing red light</li>
                <li><strong>Trace amounts:</strong> Ammonia, water, hydrogen deuteride, ethane, and ethyne</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Neptune's atmosphere is notable for its active and visible weather patterns. High-speed winds track around the planet at up to 2,100 km/h, the fastest planetary winds in the Solar System. These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h.</p>
            
            <h3>The Great Dark Spot</h3>
            <p>In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anti-cyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km × 6,600 km, was discovered by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The Great Dark Spot was not observed five years later when the Hubble Space Telescope imaged Neptune. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere.</p>
            
            <h3>Neptune's Ring System</h3>
            <p>Neptune has a planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a reddish hue. The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the center of Neptune; the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km; and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km.</p>

            <h3>Neptune's Major Moons</h3>
            <p>Neptune has 14 known moons. The largest by far is Triton, discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself:</p>
            <div class="moons-grid">
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Triton</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 2,700 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Neptune: 354,800 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 5.88 days (retrograde)</p>
                    <p>Triton is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, which is an orbit in the direction opposite to its planet's rotation. This suggests that Triton was captured from the Kuiper belt. It has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere and is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System at -235°C. Triton is geologically active, with geysers of nitrogen gas and dust erupting from its polar cap.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Nereid</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 340 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Neptune: 5,513,400 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 360.1 days</p>
                    <p>Nereid is Neptune's third-largest moon and has one of the most eccentric orbits of any moon in the Solar System. Its distance from Neptune varies from 1.4 million km to 9.7 million km.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Proteus</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 420 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Neptune: 117,600 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 1.12 days</p>
                    <p>Proteus is Neptune's second-largest moon and is heavily cratered with complex geological features. It is nearly the maximum size for a body that remains irregular in shape rather than becoming spherical under its own gravity.</p>
