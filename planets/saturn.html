            <h2>About Saturn</h2>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine and a half times that of Earth. Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, and its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.</p>
            
            <p>Saturn is best known for its prominent ring system, which consists of nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs. The rings are composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. The rings extend from 7,000 km to 80,000 km above Saturn's equator and are only about 10 meters thick.</p>
            
            <p>Saturn has at least 82 moons, 53 of which have formal names. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is larger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.</p>
            
            <h3>Saturn's Structure</h3>
            <p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant and lacks a definite solid surface. Its structure consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Primarily hydrogen and helium, with traces of ammonia, methane, water vapor, and other compounds</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Hydrogen Layer:</strong> Below the atmosphere, hydrogen transitions to a liquid state</li>
                <li><strong>Liquid Metallic Hydrogen Layer:</strong> Under extreme pressure, hydrogen becomes metallic and conducts electricity</li>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A rocky core composed of iron, nickel, silicon, and oxygen compounds, surrounded by a layer of metallic hydrogen</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Saturn's Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much fainter and wider near the equator. The top of Saturn's atmosphere contains ammonia ice crystals, while the lower levels contain water ice crystals.</p>
            
            <p>Saturn's winds are among the fastest in the Solar System, reaching speeds of 1,800 km/h near the equator. The planet also features periodic storms, including a hexagonal cloud pattern around the north pole that has been observed since the Voyager missions in the 1980s.</p>
            
            <h3>Saturn's Ring System</h3>
            <p>Saturn's rings are the most extensive planetary ring system in the Solar System. The main rings are labeled alphabetically in the order they were discovered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>D Ring:</strong> The innermost ring, faint and closest to Saturn</li>
                <li><strong>C Ring:</strong> A relatively faint ring inside the B Ring</li>
                <li><strong>B Ring:</strong> The brightest and most opaque of Saturn's rings</li>
                <li><strong>A Ring:</strong> The outermost of the main bright rings</li>
                <li><strong>F Ring:</strong> A thin, narrow ring just outside the A Ring</li>
                <li><strong>G Ring:</strong> A very thin, faint ring outside the F Ring</li>
                <li><strong>E Ring:</strong> The outermost ring, extremely wide and diffuse</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The rings are not solid but are composed of countless small particles ranging in size from micrometers to meters, each orbiting Saturn independently. The particles are mostly water ice with some rocky material.</p>

            <h3>Saturn's Major Moons</h3>
            <p>Saturn has 82 known moons. Here are some of the most significant:</p>
            <div class="moons-grid">
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Titan</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 5,150 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Saturn: 1,221,870 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 15.95 days</p>
                    <p>Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second-largest moon in the Solar System. It is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen with clouds of methane and ethane. Titan has lakes of liquid methane and ethane on its surface and may have a subsurface ocean of water.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Enceladus</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 504 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Saturn: 238,020 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 1.37 days</p>
                    <p>Enceladus is a small, icy moon with a highly reflective surface. It is geologically active, with water vapor plumes erupting from its south polar region. These plumes suggest the presence of a subsurface ocean, making Enceladus a target of interest in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Mimas</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 396 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Saturn: 185,520 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 0.94 days</p>
                    <p>Mimas is known for its large impact crater, Herschel, which gives it an appearance similar to the Death Star from Star Wars. The crater is about one-third the diameter of the moon itself.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Iapetus</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 1,469 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Saturn: 3,560,820 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 79.32 days</p>
                    <p>Iapetus has a distinctive two-tone coloration, with one hemisphere much darker than the other. It also has an equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon, giving it a walnut-like appearance.</p>
