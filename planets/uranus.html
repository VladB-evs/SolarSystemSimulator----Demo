            <h2>About Uranus</h2>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest planet in our Solar System by diameter. It is an ice giant, similar in composition to Neptune, and distinctly different from the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus was the first planet discovered in modern times, as it is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed through a telescope in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel.</p>
            
            <p>One of Uranus's most distinctive features is its axial tilt of 97.8 degrees, which means it essentially rotates on its side with its poles pointing toward and away from the Sun at different points in its orbit. This extreme tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the Solar System, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.</p>
            
            <p>Uranus has a pale blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue-green light. The planet has 27 known moons, all named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope, and a system of 13 faint rings.</p>
            
            <h3>Uranus's Structure</h3>
            <p>Uranus is classified as an ice giant because its interior is composed primarily of ices and rock rather than primarily hydrogen and helium like the gas giants. Its structure consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core:</strong> A relatively small rocky core, possibly about the size of Earth</li>
                <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> A thick layer of electrically conductive fluid composed of water, ammonia, and methane ices</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> An outer gaseous layer of hydrogen, helium, and methane</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Uranus's Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>Uranus's atmosphere is composed primarily of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen (83%):</strong> The most abundant element</li>
                <li><strong>Helium (15%):</strong> The second most abundant element</li>
                <li><strong>Methane (2%):</strong> Gives Uranus its blue-green color</li>
                <li><strong>Trace amounts:</strong> Ammonia, water vapor, and other hydrocarbons</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, which have numerous visible cloud bands and storms, Uranus appears relatively featureless to most telescopes. However, observations from the Voyager 2 spacecraft and advanced Earth-based telescopes have revealed some cloud structures and seasonal changes in the atmosphere.</p>
            
            <h3>Uranus's Ring System</h3>
            <p>Uranus has a system of 13 known rings, which are much fainter and darker than those of Saturn. The rings are composed of relatively large particles ranging from dust-sized to boulder-sized, and they are very narrow, typically only a few kilometers wide. The rings are thought to be relatively young, perhaps less than 600 million years old.</p>
            
            <h3>Uranus's Unique Rotation</h3>
            <p>Uranus's extreme axial tilt of 97.8 degrees means that it rotates nearly perpendicular to its orbital plane, essentially rolling around the Sun on its side. This unique orientation is thought to be the result of a massive collision with an Earth-sized object early in the Solar System's history. As a result of this tilt, Uranus experiences extreme seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness during its 84-year orbit around the Sun.</p>

            <h3>Uranus's Major Moons</h3>
            <p>Uranus has 27 known moons, all named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five largest moons are:</p>
            <div class="moons-grid">
                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Miranda</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 472 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Uranus: 129,390 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 1.41 days</p>
                    <p>Miranda is the smallest and innermost of Uranus's five major moons. Despite its small size, it has one of the most extreme and varied topographies of any object in the Solar System, featuring huge canyons, terraced layers, and a jumbled landscape that suggests it was shattered and reassembled multiple times in its history.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Ariel</h4>

                    <p>Orbital Period: 2.52 days</p>
                    <p>Ariel is the fourth-largest moon of Uranus and appears to have the youngest surface among its major moons. It shows evidence of past geological activity, with many valleys and relatively few impact craters compared to other moons.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Umbriel</h4>

                    <p>Orbital Period: 4.14 days</p>
                    <p>Umbriel is the darkest of Uranus's major moons and appears to have the oldest surface, heavily cratered with little evidence of recent geological activity. It has a mysterious bright ring on its surface called the "fluorescent cheerio."</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Titania</h4>

                    <p>Orbital Period: 8.71 days</p>
                    <p>Titania is the largest moon of Uranus and shows evidence of past geological activity, with a system of enormous canyons and signs of resurfacing. It may have a small subsurface ocean at the core-mantle boundary.</p>

                <div class="moon-card">
                    <h4>Oberon</h4>
                    <p>Diameter: 1,522 km</p>
                    <p>Distance from Uranus: 583,500 km</p>
                    <p>Orbital Period: 13.46 days</p>
                    <p>Oberon is the second-largest and outermost of the five major moons of Uranus. It has an old, heavily cratered surface with little evidence of internal activity and is characterized by several large impact craters surrounded by bright rays.</p>
